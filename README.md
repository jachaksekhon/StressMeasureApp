What is it?

A mobile Android application that presents users with a view of images that are correlated with specific expressions of "stress".
Users are able to click on the image that best describes their current emotional state and that data will be stored for analzying the users stress levels.

How it works:

After users select an image representing their current emotional state, they can visit the results page which shows them a graph outlining their previous inputs. This will allow users to monitor times they were most stressed and least stressed.
